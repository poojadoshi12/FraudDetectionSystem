# FraudDetectionSystem
Financial document analysis system for fraud detection using anomaly detection

## 🚧 Project Status: In Development

This project is actively being developed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate end-to-end ML system development.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Build a production-ready fraud detection system that:
- Extracts information from financial documents (invoices, receipts, statements)
- Detects anomalies and patterns indicative of fraud
- Provides explainable fraud risk scores
